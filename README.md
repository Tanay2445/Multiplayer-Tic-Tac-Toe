# Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, alternating turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

Features:
Two-Player Mode: Play with a friend, taking turns to place your markers ('X' and 'O') on the board.

Interactive Gameplay: Players can select their preferred slot to place their marker by entering the corresponding number.

Automatic Win Detection: The game checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals) after each move.

Draw Condition: If the board is filled without any player winning, the game declares a draw.

Input Validation: Ensures that players can only place markers in available slots, and only allows valid input.

How to Run:
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.

Compile and run the program to start playing.

Code Overview:
main.cpp: The main file containing the game logic, including board display, marker placement, player switching, and win detection.

Future Improvements

Adding a single-player mode with an AI opponent.

Implementing a graphical interface for a more interactive experience.
